## Boeing 737 MAX Project Writeup

MAE 4300 - Engineers and Society

---

Throughout the semester in MAE 4300, I explored engineering ethics through the lens of the Boeing 737 MAX disasters. What stood out most to me was that the failure did not come down to a single bad design choice or isolated mistake. Instead, it emerged from a complex system in which technical decisions, organizational pressure, and regulatory structures interacted in ways that ultimately undermined public safety.

From a technical standpoint, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was introduced to compensate for aerodynamic changes caused by larger engines. While the system functioned as intended under normal conditions, it relied on input from a single angle-of-attack sensor. This introduced a critical single point of failure in a safety-critical flight control system. When that sensor malfunctioned, MCAS could repeatedly command nose-down inputs without sufficient redundancy or clear pilot awareness, leaving little room for recovery.
These technical issues were made far more dangerous by the broader ethical and organizational context. Although design alternatives such as sensor redundancy, limits on system authority, or simulator training were technically feasible, competitive pressure, cost constraints, and tight schedules pushed decision-makers toward minimizing changes that could delay certification. In practice, safety became something to manage within constraints rather than the principle guiding the design process.

Engineers and test pilots were not unaware of these risks. However, ethical responsibility in engineering does not exist in isolation. Hierarchical decision-making structures, concerns about job security, and limited authority constrained individuals’ ability to act on their professional judgment. As decisions moved upward through the organization, responsibility became increasingly diffuse, making it harder for any single person to intervene effectively.
Additionally, regulatory oversight further complicated matters. The FAA’s delegation of certification authority to Boeing blurred the line between regulator and manufacturer and reinforced the idea that meeting minimum regulatory requirements was enough. In safety-critical engineering, however, ethical responsibility goes beyond compliance. A design can satisfy legal standards while still falling short of an engineer’s fundamental duty to protect the public.
Looking at the case through established engineering ethics principles makes this especially clear. Codes such as those from ASME emphasize that public safety must take precedence over employer loyalty, cost concerns, or competitive advantage. Approving and deploying a system with known single-point-of-failure characteristics in commercial aviation violated that obligation, regardless of the organizational pressures involved.

Ultimately, the Boeing 737 MAX case reinforced for me that ethical engineering requires far more than technical competence. It depends on systems, cultures, and regulatory frameworks that consistently support safety-first decision-making, even when doing so is inconvenient or costly. When ethical responsibility becomes secondary, the consequences are not abstract.  Rather, they are measured in human lives.
