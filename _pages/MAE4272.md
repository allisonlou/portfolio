This project involved the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a small-scale wind turbine blade aimed at maximizing aerodynamic power extraction while maintaining strict structural and operational safety margins. The blade was designed to address failure modes observed in a previous iteration by enforcing conservative limits on root bending stress, rotational speed, geometry, and manufacturability. Performance was optimized across a realistic wind-speed distribution using analytical modeling, with the goal of achieving efficient operation without overspeed or structural failure.

Our team followed a model-driven design approach combining airfoil performance data, blade element theory, and iterative geometry refinement. Using NACA 4412 airfoil data and a target angle of attack near 6–8°, we defined twist and chord distributions to balance lift generation, stall margin, and structural loading. A MATLAB-based analytical model was developed to predict torque and power across wind and rotational speeds, guiding decisions on blade length, wall thickness, and operating tip-speed ratio while respecting laboratory and fabrication constraints.

The finalized blade was tested in a wind tunnel across multiple fixed wind speeds by sweeping torque load and measuring rotational speed and torque to generate power curves. Experimental data showed safe, repeatable operation across all test conditions, with peak power increasing with wind speed. However, peak performance occurred at lower rotational speeds than predicted, with early stall limiting aerodynamic efficiency. Comparison between experimental results and model predictions highlighted the impact of conservative geometry, three-dimensional effects, and surface roughness on real-world performance.

I contributed primarily to the CAD modeling for the blade and data-analysis efforts. I helped to interpret discrepancies between theoretical predictions and wind-tunnel results, linking observed stall behavior and reduced RPM to geometric and aerodynamic assumptions, and contributed to recommendations for future design iterations focused on improving lift near the blade tip.
